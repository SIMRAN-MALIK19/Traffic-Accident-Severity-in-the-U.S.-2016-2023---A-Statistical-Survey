## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load-data}
accidents<-read.csv("US_Accidents_March23.csv",as.is=T)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r names}
names(accidents)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
summary(accidents)
```
```{r}
str(accidents)
```

  # Return the value with the highest occurrence
  distinct_values[which.max(distinct_tabulate)]

selected_data <- accidents[c(selected_variable, other_variables)]

pairs(selected_data, pch = 16, col = "blue", cex.labels = 1.5)
```
Interpretation: There does not seem to be any strong correlation of distance with the continuous weather variables

we will still check the numerical values of the correlation


```{r}

cor1=cor(subset_data$Distance.mi.,subset_data$Temperature.F.)
print(cor1)
cor2=cor(subset_data$Distance.mi.,subset_data$Wind_Chill.F.)
print(cor2)
cor3=cor(subset_data$Distance.mi.,subset_data$Pressure.in.)
print(cor3)
cor4=cor(subset_data$Distance.mi.,subset_data$Visibility.mi.)
print(cor4)
cor5=cor(subset_data$Distance.mi.,subset_data$Wind_Speed.mph.)
print(cor5)
cor6=cor(subset_data$Distance.mi.,subset_data$Humidity...)
print(cor6)
cor7=cor(subset_data$Distance.mi.,subset_data$Precipitation.in.)
print(cor7)


```
interpretation: There is no visible linear correlation of distance with any of the continuous weather variables

Let's try to fit a linear model with the variable with highest absolute correlation coefficient -pressure
```{r}
lm1<-lm(subset_data$Distance.mi.~subset_data$Pressure.in.,data=subset_data)
summary(lm1)
```
The multiple R square value is very low, indicating that Pressure cannot predict the distance variable well, and the two variables do not have a linear relationship.
Lets see if this output coincides with the assumptions of the model

Checking assumptions:
1)linearity- this condition is not satisfied as there does not seem to be any linear relation of distance with pressure
```{r}
library(mosaic)
xyplot(subset_data$Distance.mi.~subset_data$Pressure.in.,data=subset_data, type=c("p","r"))
```
2)constant variance and Independence: There is a pattern in the scatterplot of residuals, the spread is not random. There seem to be more residuals on the positive side of x=0, showing that the expected values of residuals is not zero.

```{r}
residuals <- residuals(model1)

# Create an XY plot of residuals
plot(lm1$fitted.values, residuals, 
     xlab = "Fitted values", ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs Fitted Values")
```
3)Normality:
The qq plot is far from linear. Therefore there is no normality in the spread of residuals.This condition is not satisfied


```{r}
qqmath(~resid(lm1))
ladd(panel.qqmathline(resid(lm1)))
```


Conclusion: all four assumptions are not satisfied,which inline with the low multiple R square value of the fitted model, hence we cannot use SLR. 

therefore linear model does not represent the relationship between the continuous weather variables and distance response variable

lets try to fit a multiple linear model to study the relationship between the continuous weather variables and distance response variable
```{r}
mlr_model <- lm(Distance.mi. ~  + Temperature.F. + Wind_Chill.F. + Pressure.in.+ Visibility.mi.+Wind_Speed.mph.+Precipitation.in., data = accidents)

# Summary of the regression model
summary(mlr_model)
```
The Multiple R square value is very low. therefor this model is not a good fit

lets try to scale the values with log scaling and check the values of correlation
```{r}
subset_data$TDistance.mi.<- log(subset_data$Distance.mi.)
subset_data$TTemperature.F.<- log(subset_data$Temperature.F.)
subset_data$TWind_Chill.F.<- log(subset_data$Wind_Chill.F.)
subset_data$TPressure.in.<- log(subset_data$Pressure.in.)
subset_data$TVisibility.mi.<- log(subset_data$Visibility.mi.)
subset_data$TWind_Speed.mph.<- log(subset_data$Wind_Speed.mph.)
subset_data$THumidity...<- log(subset_data$Humidity...)
subset_data$TPrecipitation.in.<- log(subset_data$Precipitation.in.)

replace_na_with_median <- function(x) {
  median_value <- median(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  replace(x, is.na(x), median_value)
}

# Replace NaN values with median for each column
subset_data$TDistance.mi. <- replace_na_with_median(scale(subset_data$Distance.mi.))
subset_data$TTemperature.F. <- replace_na_with_median(scale(subset_data$Temperature.F.))
subset_data$TWind_Chill.F. <- replace_na_with_median(scale(subset_data$Wind_Chill.F.))
subset_data$TPressure.in. <- replace_na_with_median(scale(subset_data$Pressure.in.))
subset_data$TVisibility.mi. <- replace_na_with_median(scale(subset_data$Visibility.mi.))
subset_data$TWind_Speed.mph. <- replace_na_with_median(scale(subset_data$Wind_Speed.mph.))
subset_data$THumidity... <- replace_na_with_median(scale(subset_data$Humidity...))
subset_data$TPrecipitation.in. <- replace_na_with_median(scale(subset_data$Precipitation.in.))

cor1=cor(subset_data$TDistance.mi.~subset_data$TTemperature.F.)
print(cor1)
cor2=cor(subset_data$TDistance.mi.~subset_data$TWind_Chill.F.)
print(cor2)
cor3=cor(subset_data$TDistance.mi.~subset_data$TPressure.in.)
print(cor3)
cor4=cor(subset_data$TDistance.mi.~subset_data$TVisibility.mi.)
print(cor4)
cor5=cor(subset_data$TDistance.mi.~subset_data$TWind_Speed.mph.)
print(cor5)
cor6=cor(subset_data$TDistance.mi.~subset_data$THumidity...)
print(cor6)
cor7=cor(subset_data$TDistance.mi.~subset_data$TPrecipitation.in.)
print(cor7)
```
the correlations of distance response variable with continuous weather variables after scaling log scaling (also tried with standard scaling) are very low. 
lets try to fit a polynomial model.
```{r}
subset_data$Severity <- accidents$Severity
sum(is.na(subset_data$Severity))
colnames(subset_data)
# Fit a quadratic polynomial regression
model1 <- lm(subset_data$Severity ~ poly(subset_data$Temperature.F.
, degree = 2) + poly(subset_data$Wind_Chill.F., degree = 2)
+poly(subset_data$Pressure.in.,degree = 2)
+poly(subset_data$Visibility.mi., degree = 2) 
+poly(subset_data$Wind_Speed.mph., degree = 2) 
+poly(subset_data$Humidity..., degree = 2) +poly(Precipitation.in., degree = 2),data = subset_data)
summary(model1)
```
The Multiple R square value is very low. therefore this model is also not a good fit
Hence we can conclude that the continuous weather variables are not sufficient on their own to predict the distance.

We can now try to study the relationship of continuous weather variables with severity rating of the accident.

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(ordinal)
subset_data$Severity <- factor(subset_data$Severity, ordered = TRUE)

# Fit an ordinal regression model
clm_model <- clm( subset_data$Severity~ subset_data$Temperature.F. + subset_data$Wind_Chill.F. +subset_data$Pressure.in.+ subset_data$Visibility.mi. +subset_data$Wind_Speed.mph.+ subset_data$Humidity...+subset_data$Precipitation.in., data = subset_data)
summary(clm_model)

```
Choice of model: "Severity" response variable is ordered and has values "","","","" based on how severe the accident was. We want to analyse the relationship between severity of the accident and our continuous weather variables. Therefore we will have to use an ordinal regression model. 
Cumulative link model (CLM) is a powerful model for such data since observations are treated correctly as categorical, the ordered nature is exploited and the flexible regression framework allows for in-depth analyses.

Assumptions:
1)Independence of Observations:
Observations in your dataset should be independent of each other. This means that the occurrence or value of the response variable for one observation should not be influenced by or correlated with the occurrence or value of the response variable for any other observation.

2)Proportional Odds Assumption:
The proportional odds assumption, also known as the parallel regression assumption, states that the effect of a predictor variable on the odds of being in a higher response category is constant across all levels of the response variable.

Since we have a large dataset with observations that are collected randomly in different areas and includes a vast number of accidents with different levels of severity, we assume these conditions are satisfied.
